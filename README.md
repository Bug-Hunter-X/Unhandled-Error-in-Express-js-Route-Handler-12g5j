# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failure to handle errors gracefully in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that doesn't handle invalid user IDs, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected responses. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` route handler fetches a user based on an ID. If the ID is invalid, it does not handle the error, leading to potential crashes or internal server errors. This is a very common scenario, and appropriate error handling is crucial for robustness.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution by wrapping the database query in a `try...catch` block. This way, any errors encountered during the query are caught, and an appropriate error response is sent back to the client.  This ensures a more reliable and user-friendly application.
